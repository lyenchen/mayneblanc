                <h2>Egg-Shaped Barrels</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Egg-shaped barrels are used for malolactic fermentation, which produces richer and more silky-mouthfeel wines, less reductive than when fermentation takes place in stainless steel tanks or in clay vats.</p>
              <p>The unique shape of this tank allows it to create a vortex (a continuous flow/circulation of liquid in the tank), which is slow and a natural bream that allows the wine (and the heavy particles) to flow, creating a more homogenous liquid. And therefore, there is also no need to stir the wine manually.</p>
              <p>The aim is also to leave no residual taste, which gives us the wines that are a great expression of its terroir.</p>
              <p>One of the most prestigious estates, such as Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc, is also using the egg-shaped barrels!</p>
