                <h2>The Vinification</h2>
              </div>
              <p>The 3 first years following planting, the soil is ploughed to encourage vine root development. Then the rows are seeded with grass in order to control the growth of the vines.</p>
              <p>Harvest is carried out in an orderly and efficient manner by selecting the best plots according to their quality and maturity. Vinification is traditional and vatting lasts between 3 to 4 weeks at controlled temperature for a slow but intense extraction of colour and tannins. The wine is regularly transferred out from the bottom of the vats and pumped back in order to extract the most aromatic compounds from the seeds and skins.</p>
              <p>Oval, egg-shaped barrels are used for malolactic fermentation, which ferments richer and softer wines, as compared to fermentation in stainless steel or clay vats.  A proportion of the wine (30-40%) is then aged in oak barrels (new and old) for 12 to 15 months.</p>
              <p>Our Winemaking team conducts tastings of the barreled-wines on a regular basis, and strive to present the most quality wine at the right time.</p>
