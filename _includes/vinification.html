              </div>
              <p>Harvest is carried out in an orderly and efficient manner by selecting the best plots according to their quality and maturity.</p>
              <p>The grapes are then put into 3 to 4 weeks of controlled-temperature alcoholic fermentation for a slow yet intense extraction of the colourings and tannins.</p>
              <p>Grapes are added into the oval, egg-shaped tanks for fermentation, which ferments richer and softer wines, as compared to fermentation in square tanks.Wine is regularly transferred out from the bottom of the vats and pumped back in order to extract the most aromatic compounds from the seeds and skins.Â A proportion of the wine (30-40%) is then aged in oak barrels (new and old) for 12 to 15 months.</p>
              <p>Our winemaking team conducts tastings of the barreled-wines on a regular basis, and strive to present the most quality wine at the right time.</p>
